## Education
- **Brandenburgische Technische Universität Cottbus-Senftenberg** (2023 - 2026):
  Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence
  Studying AI at BTU Cottbus, focusing on machine learning and deep learning for innovative solutions.

- **Alzahra University** (2016 - 2020):
  Bachelor's degree in Computer Science
  Studied Computer Science at Alzahra University.


## Projects
- **Bicycle Usage Pattern Prediction in Europe** (Jan 2023 - Feb 2023):
  Analyzed historical data on bicycle usage, weather patterns, and gender demographics in Europe using regression analysis and data visualization techniques. Developed a predictive model achieving an 84% accuracy rate in forecasting bicycle usage based on weather conditions and gender demographics.

- **Anki Automation** (Apr 2022 - Jun 2022):
  Developed a Python program that creates flashcards from a given list of words. The software retrieves meaning, pronunciation audio, examples, and word genders using Google Translate and forvo.com. Utilized ANKI software to generate flashcards and saved them to a database or Excel file for future use.

- **Crypto Price Watcher** (May 2022 - Jun 2022):
  Monitored selected cryptocurrencies and sent alerts and emails (using regular expressions and SMTP) when certain thresholds were reached. Automated the update of the next threshold when the first one was met.

- **Grade Analyzer** (Apr 2022 - May 2022):
  Developed a program using seaborn to visualize grades in different skills such as reading and listening, providing an overview of progress by giving average and progress rates. Also compared different students' performance.

- **Automated Watch-face Makers** (Aug 2018 - Sep 2020):
  Developed an automation software tool simplifying the process of creating customized Samsung watch faces. The tool automatically downloaded images and licenses from freepik.com, used OpenCV and Pillow to modify XML of watch faces with appropriate colors, filled out a 3-page form, uploaded backgrounds and screenshots, and translated titles, descriptions, and tags into seven different languages.

- **Gender Detection Using Deep Learning** (Jan 2020 - Sep 2020):
  Prepared a web scraper to gather data and images for training the algorithm, then used Keras and TensorFlow to detect gender of a person in a given picture with an accuracy rate display.
